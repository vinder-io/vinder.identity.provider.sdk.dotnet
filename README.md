<h1 align="center">IDENTITY PROVIDER - SDK FOR .NET</h1>

### About This Project

This is the official .NET SDK for **Vinder Identity Provider**. Its goal is simple: make it easier for .NET applications to talk to the identity provider without reinventing the wheel.

Here, we focus on **great developer experience** (DX). Everything is designed to be predictable, clear, and productive for developers. We use the Result Pattern, so every operation returns a clear result, with all expected errors typed, described, and coded.

Every error has a detailed description and code. Your IDE will show full XML docs, listing all errors, their codes, descriptions, when they occur, and how to handle them. There’s even a link in the docs to the official reference for error handling, so you always know what can go wrong and how to react.

We provide strongly-typed clients, payloads, and helpers so you can authenticate users, manage tenants, and handle permissions with minimal boilerplate. No magic, no heavy abstractions — just code that works.

The SDK is lightweight and fully focused on what your app actually needs. Forget about endless configuration or obscure XML/JSON files. You get a clean, simple API to interact with the identity provider in the way most .NET developers expect.

Perfect for building small to medium applications, microservices, or any .NET backend that needs to authenticate users or interact with other services secured by the identity provider. It’s designed for productivity and clarity, not enterprise-grade complexity.
